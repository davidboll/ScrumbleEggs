                text: 'The Agile "Software Development" Manifesto emerged from a meeting held on February 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in Utah. It represents a collaborative effort among various software development methodologies, including Extreme Programming, SCRUM, DSDM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Feature-Driven Development, and Pragmatic Programming. The term "agile" was chosen, although some participants had concerns about its pronunciation. The Agile Alliance, formed by independent thinkers in software development, adopted the Manifesto as a guiding principle. (link to Agile manifesto) ',

                text2: 'The meeting at Snowbird ski resort was preceded by a gathering organized by Kent Beck at the Rogue River Lodge in Oregon in the spring of 2000, which primarily focused on Extreme Programming proponents and a few outsiders. Discussions about "Light" or "Lightweight" methodologies took place throughout 2000, with proponents like Bob Martin advocating for a conference to bring together leaders in the field. Alistair Cockburn expressed dissatisfaction with the term "Light" due to its connotations. Eventually, a meeting was arranged in January to February 2001 in Chicago, leading to debates over the location, with Snowbird, Utah, being chosen. The Agile Alliance aims to promote innovative thinking in software development methodologies and organizations, encouraging agility in approach and mindset ',

                principle2: 'Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage', 
                principle3: 'Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.', 
                principle4: 'Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.', 
                principle5: 'Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.', 
                principle6: 'The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.',

                principle8: 'Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.', 
                principle9: 'Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.',

                principle12: 'At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.',
